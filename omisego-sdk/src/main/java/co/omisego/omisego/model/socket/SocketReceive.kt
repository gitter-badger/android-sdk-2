 * A model for receiving the replied object from the eWallet web socket API.

 * Note that those events can either be successful or not.
 *
 * For example, when sending the [SocketCustomEvent.TRANSACTION_CONSUMPTION_FINALIZED],
 * it is possible to receive the finalized consumption OR an error stating that it was finalized in a failed state because there were not enough funds for the actual transaction to proceed.
